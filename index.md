# 👋 Hi, I'm **Tingrui Zhang**  
Phone: +1 734-913-3498 · Email: tingruiz@umich.edu · Ann Arbor, MI

I am an undergraduate researcher in **Computer Engineering** at the University of Michigan, minoring in Mathematics. My research focuses on **machine learning, computer vision, diffusion models, and spatial/biomedical imaging**. I work with **Asst. Prof. Cong Ma** on scalable probabilistic models for spatial transcriptomics, and with **Prof. Min Xu** (CMU) on spatial-relation-aware diffusion models.

My long-term interest lies in the intersection of **ML + Bio/Health**, including generative modeling, computational pathology, and spatial-omics representation learning.

You can find my publications on
